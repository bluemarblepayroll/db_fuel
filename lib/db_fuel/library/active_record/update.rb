      # This job can take the unique objects in a register and updates them within database table.
      # The attributes translate to SQL SET clauses and the unique_keys translate to
      # WHERE clauses to find the records to update. The primary_key is used to update the unique record.
      #
      # Expected Payload[register] input: array of objects
      # Payload[register] output: array of objects.
      class Update < Upsert
        # Arguments:
        #   name [required]: name of the job within the Burner::Pipeline.
        #
        #   table_name [required]: name of the table to use for the INSERT statements.
        #
        #   attributes:  Used to specify which object properties to put into the
        #                SQL statement and also allows for one last custom transformation
        #                pipeline, in case the data calls for SQL-specific transformers
        #                before mutation.
        #
        #   debug: If debug is set to true (defaults to false) then the SQL statements and
        #          returned objects will be printed in the output.  Only use this option while
        #          debugging issues as it will fill up the output with (potentially too much) data.
        #
        #   primary_key [required]: Primary key column for the corresponding table.
        #                           Used as the WHERE clause for the UPDATE statement.
        #                           Only one record will be updated at a time using the primary key specified.
        #
        #   separator: Just like other jobs with a 'separator' option, if the objects require
        #              key-path notation or nested object support, you can set the separator
        #              to something non-blank (like a period for notation in the
        #              form of: name.first).
        #
        #   timestamps: If timestamps is true (default behavior) then the updated_at column will
        #               automatically have its value set to the current UTC timestamp.
        #
        #   unique_attributes: Each key will become a WHERE clause in order to only find specific
        #                      records. The UPDATE statement's WHERE clause will use the primary key specified.
